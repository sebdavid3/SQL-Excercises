# Learning Progress in SQL and Databases

This repository contains my progress in learning SQL and Databases. The exercises come from two main sources:

1. **SQLBolt**: Interactive SQL exercises to learn from basic to advanced concepts.
2. **Database Class**: Practical exercises from my Database course.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a topic or set of exercises. The exercises are organized as follows:
